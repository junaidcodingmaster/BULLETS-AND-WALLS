        <h1 style="text-align: center;">BULLETS AND WALLS</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">The Military saw your Car collision project and they were interested in assigning you another project. They have given you $1000 to test the reliability of walls when bullets hit them.<br>They test the effectiveness of walls against bullets, amongst other things. All walls are made of concrete material. If the damage to the wall from the bullet exceeds a certain value, the material used to make the wall is rejected.</br></p>
